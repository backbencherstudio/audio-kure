My oncologist team told me my chemo radiation treatment will be very painful and I don’t do well with meds. That’s how I found Dr. Moghazy to help me to go through it all. I’ve became so strong in many aspects because of what I’ve learned during the sessions. I’m so grateful for his work and I think it’s ideal to work together with traditional and quantum medical hypnoses."

Not only is he super personable,  knowledgeable (so he really knows his stuff) he personalizes his approach for You as the individual client. As someone trained in many modalities, I came to Dr. M to help me with something I couldn't overcome on my own, with all the tools I already had.  He was fantastic to work with and we have made great progress on my issue. I walked out of the office with so much more Confidence than I came in with! If Change is what you're looking for, Dr. M is the one to get you there!"

I had never tried hypnotherapy before but I am now a true believer!! Dr. Moghazy is incredibly talented and genuinely invested in the positive progress and outcomes of his patients. His skill and natural healing ability make sessions comfortable and productive! In just a few months of weekly sessions, I not only have relief from the crippling feelings of sadness and helplessness associated with cancer in the life of someone I love..."
